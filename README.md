## ðŸ§  Enhanced AI Detection Overview
The enhanced AI analysis uses 10 different detection methods to identify AI-generated or manipulated medical images. Each method looks for specific artifacts and patterns that are common in AI-generated content.

The 10 Detection Methods:
1. **Frequency Domain Analysis**
What it detects: AI generation artifacts in frequency patterns
How it works: Analyzes the frequency distribution of image data
AI indicators: Excessive high-frequency content or abnormally low frequency content
Confidence: 80-85% when artifacts detected
2. **Noise Inconsistency Detection**
What it detects: Unnaturally uniform noise patterns
How it works: Analyzes noise variance across different image regions
AI indicators: Extremely uniform noise (AI generators often produce consistent noise)
Confidence: 85% when uniform noise detected
3. **Advanced Compression Artifact Detection**
What it detects: Unusual compression patterns and AI generation signatures
How it works: Analyzes JPEG compression artifacts and block variance
AI indicators: Unusual compression ratios or patterns not typical of real cameras
Confidence: 75-80% when suspicious patterns found
